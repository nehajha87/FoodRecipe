# FoodRecipe

This is food related application if anybody wants to cook and they have the common ingredients and they do not know the recipe or more ingredients let say i have cheese but i don't
know how to make things with the help of cheese so i just need to search for cheese and it will show the foods that cooked with the help of cheese. Similary you can search for any thing.

And this is the api from where i got the data:-  https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
